## Motivation

In the last few years there has been a resurgence in the interest for eastern spiritual practices. The covid lockdowns served as a catalizer for many to find new ways to find inner balance, once deprived from the usual western resources of going out, doing sports, going for a hike or meeting family and friends.

This resurgence is taking many flavors. On one end of the spectrum there is scientifically proven, lab-encapsulated, peer reviewed mindfulness techniques. These focus on specific benefits that can be replicated and explained at the level of brain function, hormonal change, and subjective changes in mood or focus capabilities. This end of the spectrum is all objective wellbeing and no subjective personal growth. This end of the spectrum is all technique and no belief system, no cosmology, and no metaphysics (in as much as we are comfortable to claim that the scientific method does not rest on its own series of dogmatic and axiomatic presuppositions, which cannot be scientifically proven, and are metaphisical in nature, for example the existence of objective truth, the claim that to search for this said truth is a good in itself worth pursuing, and the nature of observable phenomena and tangible matter as the starting point of reality, and so on and so forth). 

On the other end of the spectrum we have the bells and whistles of spiritual claims and cosmic tunes which merge techniques with belief system and entire cosmologies. Here we are faced with a mileu of presuppositions that fall way outside of our modern, western, scientific, materialistic, logical and rational mind. One may want to learn a technique to find calmness or solace, and find himself chanting mantras to Ganesha from his home in rural Ohio as a pre-condition to find deep peace. This end of the spectrum tilts more towards subjective identification (I am a yogi, I am a spec of God on a material reality, I am an aura of Prana reverberating through the space-time continuum), and there is little room for pragmatic function, objective truth, and simplicity.

I find both extremes useful, true in their own way, and necessary in the grand scheme of things, though unnecessary for the average Joe who is having a hard time falling asleep after a 12 hour shift and 2 hours commute.

Fortunately for the author of this project, the scientific rationale is a valid source of sobriety, and the overtly spiritual-ish is a fantastic subject of study with much to offer once wheat and chaff have been properly dealt with. The result of this attitude is having learnt a few techniques and concepts that delivered on their promises: calmness, inner silence, poise, resiliance, deep rest, and relaxation.

I managed lockdown thanks to meditation, and it has changed my life for the better. Not only in objective measures of stress reduction, but in subjective understandings as well.

Now the question was: how do I help friends and family who could benefit from these practices, but are not inclined to study (let alone adopt) a new cosmology and belief system?

This project is the answer to that question: a series of practices and inner exercises that work simply because they do, with no bells and whistles, no sanskrit, no yoga pants. A series of practices that are valid for all, from the rational materialist atheist, to the yogic devotee and the christian mystic.

This software aims to be a point of entry into serious meditative techniques. Some of these practices have passed the test of time for millennia, through their repeated delivery within their respective traditions. 

Others have passed the modern test of science, convincing us of their utility through many white coats looking at many digital screens and declaring that there is some beneficial objective truth happening inside when we follow certain internal procedures.

Devoid from their lingos and cosmologies, the internal procedures simply work, and are useful as a first step into the disciplines of meditation and inner work. 

Adding metaphisics to what actually works is useful. It is up to the user to investigate on their own, and is not at all discounted. I believe it is even necessary to incorporate these practices into a wider philosophical and cosmological picture if one wants to have a rich inner life, but it is not the aim of this software to provide such evangelism.

This software will be useful for those who wish to practice meditation for any reason, from the therapeautic to the spiritual, from the needing to relax their bodies to the needing to heal phychological or emotional pains. It is aimed to the general western population, and should be a great first step for new meditators, who will not be asked to embrace any belief system, but will be guided towards inner states of mind that even the most skeptic of personalities can test against his own subjective experience, and benefit from on a daily basis.

I believe that has value in a world in which we have made a virtue of paying too much attention to what is "out there", we celebrate being busy, cannot sustain attention for more than 140 characters, are getting crazier and more stressed by the minute. Inner real estate is more valuable than ever.

May this be part of the solution.

## Context

This software is expected to work in most desktop computers through a standard web browser.

The aim is to deliver the same content in the form of a mobile app in the future (hopefully not too distant future). Liveview Native?

The current version of the software is devised as a proof of concept, a test to discover if there would be interest in developing the project further, into a paid app, in which users will be able to take meditation courses and journeys over the course of time.

The software will be able to craft personalised meditation practices based on user preferences and availability of time. It will do so through combining pre-recorded audio snippets and streaming them to the browser or app on user request.

Three questions are asked to the user:

1. Which type of practice you want? At the moment, three are offered:
  - Nidra (also called NSDR in the scientific community)
  - Antar (inner silence practice)
  - Body Scan (a relaxation technique for the body which helps with insomnia and retrains the nervous system to diffuse habitual tensions)

2. How long do you have to practice?
  - Short (5 to 10 mins)
  - Medium (half an hour)
  - Long (an hour)

3. What type of background you prefer)
  - Silence
  - Music
  - Ambient 8D sounds


The software will access categorised mp3 and deliver a meditation practice based on these preferences.
