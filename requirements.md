## Motivation

In the last few years there has been a resurgence in the interest for eastern spiritual practices. The covid lockdowns served as a catalizer for many to find new (or ancient) ways to find inner balance, once deprived from the usual western resources of going out, doing sports, going for a hike or meeting family and friends. Once binge watching Netflix fell short... what is there to do?

This resurgence in meditation and mindfulness is taking many flavors. On one end of the spectrum there is scientifically proven, lab-encapsulated, peer reviewed mindfulness techniques. On the other end of the spectrum we have the bells and whistles of spiritual claims and cosmic tunes which merge techniques with belief systems and sophisticated cosmologies. 

I find both extremes useful, true in their own way, though unnecessary for the average Joe who is having a hard time falling asleep after eight hours of zoom meetings and not getting out much.

This project is the answer to that problem: a series of practices and inner exercises that work simply because they do, with no bells and whistles, no sanskrit, and no yoga pants. A series of practices that are valid for all, from the rational materialist atheist, to the yogic aspirant, as well as the christian traditionalist.

This software aims to be a point of entry into serious meditative techniques. Some of these practices have passed the test of time for millennia, through their repeated delivery within their respective traditions, while others are being proven effective almost every day by the modern priesthood of the white coat in the church of the lab.

Devoid from their lingos and cosmologies, the internal procedures simply work, and are useful as a first step into the discipline of meditation and the path of inner mastery. 

This software brings what works to people who simply want to use it, not necessarily to study it.

## Context

This software is expected to work in most desktop computers through a standard web browser.

The aim is to deliver the same content in the form of a mobile app in the future (hopefully not too distant future). Liveview Native?

The current version of the software is devised as a proof of concept, a test to discover if there would be interest in developing the project further, into a paid app, in which users will be able to take meditation courses and journeys over the course of time.

The software will be able to craft personalised meditation practices based on user preferences and availability of time. It will do so through combining pre-recorded audio snippets and streaming them to the browser or app on user request.


## Use cases

### Choosing your meditation

A user visits the home page and three questions are asked:

1. Which type of practice you want? At the moment the user can choose between...
  - Nidra (also called NSDR in the scientific community)
  - Antar (inner silence practice)
  - Body Scan (a relaxation technique for the body which helps with insomnia and retrains the nervous system to diffuse habitual tensions)

The user selects one, and the next page automatically loads, which presents the second set of options:

2. How long do you have to practice?
  - Short (5 to 10 mins)
  - Medium (half an hour)
  - Long (an hour)

Upon selecting this option, a third page is shown:

3. What type of background track do you prefer?
  - Silence
  - Music
  - Ambient 8D sounds (ocean, rain, forest sounds...)

Once the user chooses this third option, another page is loaded where the user is presented with a summary of his choices, and a play button to stream his customised practice session.
